When starting painting or drawing in general, it is very common to get overwhelmed by the amount of detail of other's people work and most importantly the details you observe on your surroundings.

Try this out! Close your eyes till you can omit most of the details and everything appears dim, but you can still see silhouettes of the objects. Now, the distracting details are gone. You can easily see the values and shapes of the observed objects.

This is an ability that is hard to develop. When I first enrolled at art classes in high school, and I wanted to replicate a synthesis, the first tip my art teacher gave me was to squint my eyes as much as I can, so that I can only see the values of the objects. Adding the details early on on a piece may result into destroying its balance.
